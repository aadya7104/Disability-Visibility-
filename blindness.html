      <h2>What is Blindeness or Vision Impairment?</h2>
      <p>Blindness is defined as the state of being sightless. A blind individual is unable to see. In a strict sense, the word "blindness" denotes the inability of a person to distinguish darkness from bright light in either eye. The terms blind and blindness have been modified in our society to include a wide range of visual impairment. Blindness is frequently used today to describe a severe visual decline in one or both eyes with the maintenance of some residual vision.<br><br>
Vision impairment, or low vision, means that even with eyeglasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery, someone doesn't see well. Vision impairment can range from mild to severe. Worldwide, between 300 million-400 million people are visually impaired due to various causes. Of this group, approximately 50 million people are totally blind. Approximately 80% of blindness occurs in people over 50 years of age.

<h2> Types:</h2>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Color blindness is the inability to perceive differences in various shades of colors, particularly green and red, that others can distinguish. It is most often inherited (genetic) and affects about 8% of males and under 1% of women. People who are color blind usually have normal vision otherwise and can function well visually. This is actually not true blindness.
</li>
<li class="types">Night blindness is a difficulty in seeing under situations of decreased illumination. It can be genetic or acquired. The majority of people who have night vision difficulties function well under normal lighting conditions; this is not a state of sightlessness.
</li>
<li class="types">Snow blindness is a loss of vision after exposure of the eyes to large amounts of ultraviolet light. Snow blindness is usually temporary and is due to swelling of cells of the corneal surface. Even in the most severe cases of snow blindness, the individual is still able to see shapes and movement.

<h2> Facts about Blindness in India</h2>
<<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Blindness is among one of the most widely occurring disabling condition. According to an estimate about 246 million people have low vision worldwide and and 39 million people are blind. Almost about 90% of the world’s visually impaired people live in the developing countries.

</li>
       <li class="types">Nearly 40 million people in India, including 1.6 million children, are blind or visually impaired due to uncorrected refractive error. 

</li>
        <li class="types">In India, under RPWD Act 2016, low vision is considered to be a disability. A person having benchmark disability, can avail disability benefits from the government.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p> Treatment is dependent on the cause. Some conditions are entirely curable, such as simple refractive errors and cataracts. Others are not entirely curable but often manageable, and with proper treatment, a patient may be able to retain good vision. Glaucoma is an example of a chronic condition that can often be well controlled.<br><br>
Surgery treats cataracts. Medications, laser, and/or surgery treats diabetic retinopathy, depending on the type of retinopathy. Macular degeneration is treated with medications that slow down the progression of the wet (hemorrhagic) form. Lowering eye pressure with medication, laser, and/or surgery controls glaucoma. Corneal transplants can correct many types of corneal opacities due to scarring or swelling.<br><br>
A patient's primary care doctor and other specialists are often involved in treatment when the eye condition is part of a systemic disease and requires oral or intravenous medications.<br><br>
For patients with poor vision, a low vision specialist can offer visual aids such as magnifiers that can help with daily activities.<br><br>
Research is under way for new drugs and gene therapies such as gene transfer or CRISPR gene editing to prevent and treat a variety of eye conditions.
