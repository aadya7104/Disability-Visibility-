      <h2>What is Multiple Sclerosis?</h2>
      <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-lasting (chronic) disease of the central nervous system. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the body attacks itself by mistake. MS is an unpredictable disease that affects people differently. Some people with MS may have only mild symptoms. Others may lose their ability to see clearly, write, speak, or walk when communication between the brain and other parts of the body becomes disrupted.Myelin is the fatty tissue that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. In MS, the myelin is destroyed in many areas. This loss of myelin forms scar tissue called sclerosis. These areas are also called plaques or lesions. When the nerves are damaged in this way, they canâ€™t conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain.</p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin).
<br><br>
Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked.
<br><br>
It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible.

<h2>Risk Factors</h2>
<p>These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types"><b>Age:</b> MS can occur at any age, but onset usually occurs around 20 and 40 years of age. However, younger and older people can be affected.
<li class="types"><b>Sex:</b> Women are more than two to three times as likely as men are to have relapsing-remitting MS.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Family history:</b> If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Certain infections: </b> variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Vitamin D:</b> Having low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight is associated with a greater risk of MS.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Certain autoimmune diseases:</b> You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Smoking:</b> Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting.</li>

      <h2> Some Symptoms Include</h2>
      <p>The symptoms of MS are often unpredictable. They may be mild or severe, short-term or long-lasting. They may appear in different combinations, depending on the area of the nervous system affected. <br>The following are the most common symptoms of MS. But each person may have different symptoms:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Blurred or double vision</li>
<li class="types">Red-green color distortion</li>
<li class="types">Pain and loss of vision because of swelling of the optic nerve (optic neuritis)</li>
<li class="types">Trouble walking</li>
<li class="types">An abnormal feeling or pain, such as numbness, prickling, or pins and needles (paresthesia)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Symptoms of Multiple sclerosis :</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Muscle weakness in the arms and legs</li>
<li class="types">Trouble with coordination. You may have problems walking or standing. You may also be partially or completely paralyzed.</li>
<li class="types">Spasticity. The involuntary increased tone of muscles leading to stiffness and spasms.</li>
<li class="types">Fatigue. This may be brought on by physical activity, but it may ease with rest. You may have constant tiredness that doesn't go away.</li>
<li class="types">Loss of sensation</li>
<li class="types">Speech problems</li>
<li class="types">Tremor</li>
<li class="types">Dizziness</li>
<li class="types">Hearing loss</li>
<li class="types">Bowel and bladder problems</li>
<li class="types">Depression</li>
<li class="types">Changes in sexual function</li>
</ul>
<p>About 50% of all people with MS have thinking (cognitive) problems linked to the disease. The effects of these problems may be mild. Your healthcare provider may only find them after much testing. The problems may be with:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Focusing (concentration)</li>
<li class="types">Attention</li>
<li class="types">Memory</li>
<li class="types">Poor judgment</li>
</ul>

<h2> Diagnosis</h2>
<p>No specific test is available to diagnose multiple sclerosis. But a healthcare provider can make a diagnosis by following a careful process to rule out other causes and diseases. Two things must be true to make a diagnosis of MS:<br><br>
1. You must have had 2 attacks at least 1 month apart. An attack is when any MS symptoms show up suddenly. Or when any MS symptoms get worse for at least 24 hours.
2. You must have more than 1 area of damage to the central nervous system myelin. Myelin is the sheath that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. This damage must have occurred at more than 1 point in time and not have been caused by any other disease.<br><br>
Generally a single attack along with certain patterns of changes in brain tissue seen on an MRI scan of the brain performed with contrast can mean that you have MS.<br><br>
An MS evaluation involves a complete health history and neurological exam. This includes:
</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Mental functions</li>
<li class="types">Emotional functions</li>
<li class="types">Language functions</li>
<li class="types">Movement and coordination</li>
<li class="types">Vision</li>
<li class="types">Balance</li>
<li class="types">Functions of the 5 senses</li>       
</ul> 
<p>The following may be used when evaluating a person for multiple sclerosis:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types"><b><u>MRI</u></b>: A diagnostic test that uses a combination of large magnets, sound waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures of organs and structures within the body. It can find plaques or scarring caused by MS.</li>
<li class="types"><b><u>Evoked potentials:</u></b> These tests record the brain's electrical response to visual, auditory, and sensory stimuli. These tests show if you have a slowing of messages in the different parts of the brain.</li>
<li class="types"><b><u>Cerebral spinal fluid analysis:</u></b> This is also called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture. It looks at the fluid taken from the spinal column to make an evaluation or diagnosis. This test checks for cellular and chemical abnormalities seen with MS.</li>
<li class="types"><b><u>Blood tests:</u></b> These are done to rule out other causes for various neurological symptoms.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Evaluation and diagnosis of MS requires a variety of tools to rule out other possible disorders. It also requires a series of lab tests that, if positive, confirms the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>People with multiple sclerosis may also develop:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Muscle stiffness or spasms</li>
<li class="types">Paralysis, typically in the legs</li>
<li class="types">Problems with bladder, bowel or sexual function</li>
<li class="types">Mental changes, such as forgetfulness or mood swings</li>
<li class="types">Depression</li>
<li class="types">Epilepsy</li>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment plan for you based on:
</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Your age, overall health, and past health</li>
<li class="types">How sick you are</li>
<li class="types">How well you can handle certain medicines, treatments, or therapies</li>
<li class="types">How long your condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference</li>
</ul> 
<p>There is no cure yet for MS. But you can do things to help change the course of the disease, treat flare-ups, manage symptoms, and improve your function and mobility.<br>
Treatments for the conditions seen with MS may include:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Medicines (talk with your provider to see what medicines may be an option for you)</li>
<li class="types">Equipment such as canes, braces, or walkers</li>
<li class="types">Rehabilitation activities</li>
</ul> 
<p>Rehabilitation varies depending on your symptoms and how severe they are. MS rehabilitation may help you to:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Get back functions that are important for daily living</li>
<li class="types">Be as independent as you can</li>
<li class="types">Involve your family</li>
<li class="types">Make the right decisions relating to your care</li>
<li class="types">Learn about equipment like canes, braces, or walkers that can make is easier to move around</li>
<li class="types">Set up an exercise program that builds muscle strength, endurance, and control</li>
<li class="types">Get back motor skills</li>
<li class="types">Speak more easily if you have weakness or a lack of coordination of face and tongue muscles</li>
<li class="types">Manage bowel or bladder incontinence</li>
<li class="types">Relearn thinking skills</li>
<li class="types">Change the way your home is set up to keep you safe but allow you to move about as easily as possible.</li>
