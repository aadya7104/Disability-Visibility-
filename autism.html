      <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
      <p>Autism, also called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complicated condition that includes problems with communication and behavior. It can involve a wide range of symptoms and skills. ASD can be a minor problem or a disability that needs full-time care in a special facility.<br><br>
People with autism have trouble with communication. They have trouble understanding what other people think and feel. This makes it hard for them to express themselves, either with words or through gestures, facial expressions, and touch.<br><br>
People with autism might have problems with learning. Their skills might develop unevenly. For example, they could have trouble communicating but be unusually good at art, music, math, or memory. Because of this, they might do especially well on tests of analysis or problem-solving.<br><br>
More children are diagnosed with autism now than ever before. But the latest numbers could be higher because of changes in how it’s diagnosed, not because more children have a disorder.

<h2> Types of Autism:</h2>
<p>These types were once thought to be separate conditions. Now, they fall under the range of autism spectrum disorders. They include:</P>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Asperger's syndrome. These children don't have a problem with language; in fact, they tend to score in the average or above-average range on intelligence tests. But they have social problems and a narrow scope of interests.</li>
<li class="types">Autistic disorder. This is what most people think of when they hear the word "autism." It refers to problems with social interactions, communication, and play in children younger than 3 years.</li>
<li class="types">Childhood disintegrative disorder. These children have typical development for at least 2 years and then lose some or most of their communication and social skills.</li>
<li class="types"> Developmental disorder (PDD or atypical autism). Your doctor might use this term if your child has some autistic behavior, like delays in social and communications skills, but doesn’t fit into another category.</li>

<h2> Facts about Autism in India</h2>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">According to the Indian Scale Assessment of Autism, there are approximately 2 million children with autism in India.
</li>
       <li class="types">Autism cannot be diagnosed up to 18 months and the ideal time to start its treatment is by one to two years. This is the best time because almost 80 per cent of the brain is developed in the first 36 months (three years). Unfortunately, due to sparse knowledge, parents start treatment late and it gets tough for the child to overcome the complexities. Early intervention can prevent disabilities in infants as well as toddlers.
</li>
        <li class="types">It is also important to note that autism has several spectrums. No two children suffering from autism will be the same. Every child with autism is on a different spectrum

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Exactly why autism happens isn't clear. It could stem from problems in parts of your brain that interpret sensory input and process language.<br>
Autism is four times more common in boys than in girls. It can happen in people of any race, ethnicity, or social background. Family income, lifestyle, or educational level doesn’t affect a child’s risk of autism.<br>
Autism runs in families, so certain combinations of genes may increase a child’s risk.<br>
A child with an older parent has a higher risk of autism<br>
Pregnant women who are exposed to certain drugs or chemicals, like alcohol or anti-seizure medications, are more likely to have autistic children. Other risk factors include maternal metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Research has also linked autism to untreated phenylketonuria (also called PKU, a metabolic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme) and rubella (German measles).<br>
There is no evidence that vaccinations cause autism.</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>   Behavior and Communication Treatments<br><br>
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is often used in schools and clinics to help your child learn positive behaviors and reduce negative ones. This approach can be used to improve a wide range of skills, and there are different types for different situations, including:<br>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Discrete trial training (DTT) uses simple lessons and positive reinforcement.
</li>
         <li class="types">Pivotal response training (PRT) helps develop motivation to learn and communicate.
</li>
          <li class="types">Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is best for children under age 5.
</li>
           <li class="types">Verbal behavior intervention (VBI) focuses on language skills.
</li>
            
      </ul></p>
   <p>
    Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-Based Approach (DIR): This kind of treatment is better known as Floortime. That’s because it involves you getting on the floor with your child to play and do the activities they like. It’s meant to support emotional and intellectual growth by helping them learn skills around communication and emotions.<br><br>
Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH): This treatment uses visual cues such as picture cards to help your child learn everyday skills like getting dressed. Information is broken down into small steps so they can learn it more easily.<br><br>
The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): This is another visual-based treatment, but it uses symbols instead of picture cards. Your child learns to ask questions and communicate through special symbols.<br><br>
Occupational Therapy: This kind of treatment helps your child learn life skills like feeding and dressing themselves, bathing, and understanding how to relate to other people. The skills they learn are meant to help them live as independently as they can.<br><br>
Sensory Integration Therapy: If your child is easily upset by things like bright lights, certain sounds, or the feeling of being touched, this therapy can help them learn to deal with that kind of sensory information.<br><br>
Speech Therapy: speech therapists assess the best ways to improve communication and enhance a person's quality of life. Throughout therapy, the speech-language pathologist also works closely with the family, school, and other professionals. If someone with autism is nonverbal or has major trouble with speech, the speech therapist may introduce alternatives to speech.Speech therapy can improve overall communication. This makes it possible for people with autism to improve their ability to form relationships and function in day-to-day life.<br></p>
