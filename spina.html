      <h2>What is Spina Bifida?</h2>
      <p>Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them.<br><br>
Normally, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close or develop properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.<br><br>
Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery — although such treatment doesn't always completely resolve the problem.</p>  <br>

<h2> Types of Spina Bifida:</h2>
<p>1. Spina bifida occulta<br>
"Occulta" means hidden. It's the mildest and most common type. Spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons.
<br><br>
2. Myelomeningocele<br>
Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe type. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections and may also cause paralysis and bladder and bowel dysfunction.

<h2> Facts about Spina Bifida in India</h2>
<<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">four out of every 1,000 children born in India have spina bifida, a common birth defect that often goes unnoticed due to lack of awareness.</li>
       <li class="types">This rate in India is four times that of western countries.</li>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. It's thought to result from a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate (vitamin B-9) deficiency.

      <h2> Some Symptoms Include</h2>
      <p>Spina bifida occulta:<br><br> Typically there aren't any signs or symptoms because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see signs on the newborn's skin above the spinal defect, including an abnormal tuft of hair, or a small dimple or birthmark. Sometimes, the skin marks can be signs of an underlying spinal cord issue that can be discovered with MRI or spinal ultrasound in a newborn.</p><br><br><br>
      <p>Myelomeningocele. In this severe type of spina bifida:</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">The spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back</li>
          <li class="types">Both the membranes and the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac</li>
            <li class="types">Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac</li>
                  </ul>

<h2> Effects</h2>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Walking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect. This can cause muscle weakness of the legs and sometimes paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth.</li>
<li class="types"> Orthopedic complications. Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the location of the defect.</li>
<li class="types">Bowel and bladder problems. Nerves that supply the bladder and bowels usually don't work properly when children have myelomeningocele. This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord</li>
<li class="types">Accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly experience accumulation of fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus.</li>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Treatment depends on the type of spina bifida a person has.  Myelomeningocele and meningocele require a surgery to close the bubble shortly after birth to prevent infection such as meningitis.  Most people with myelomeningocele have hydrocephalus and most of them will need a shunt placed as an infant.  Children with a closed neural tube defect may need surgery to prevent further complications such as weakness and bowel and bladder function.  Generally, people with spina bifida occulta will not need any treatment.<br><br>
Prenatal Surgery:<br>
Prenatal (before birth) surgery involves opening the mother’s abdomen and uterus (or womb) and sewing shut the abnormal opening over the developing baby’s spinal cord.  This is thought to protect the baby’s spinal cord from ongoing damage in the uterus.  The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) showed that prenatal surgery to close the defect in the spinal cord improved outcomes compared to children who had postnatal surgery for spina bifida.  Data from the 2012 study showed that prenatal surgery reduced the need to drain fluid from the brain, improved mobility, and increased the chances that a child will be able to walk independently early on.  This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.<br><br>
The procedure does not restore lost neurological function that happened before the surgery, but may prevent additional damage from occurring during the rest of the pregnancy.  Although prenatal surgery poses some risk to the fetus as well as to the mother, the benefits are promising and are still being studied.<br><br><br>
Postnatal Surgery:<br>
In treating myelomeningocele and meningocele, the key priorities are to prevent infection from developing in the exposed nerves and spinal cord through the spinal defect, and to protect the exposed nerves and spinal cord from additional trauma.  Therefore, a child born with these types of spina bifida who has not undergone prenatal surgery will have surgery to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection or further trauma within the first few days of life.<br><br><br>

      <h2> Inspiring stories of individuals with Spina Bifida</h2>
      <p> Niranjan Mukundan was born with spina bifida. He is an Indian Paralympic Swimmer; he has won over 60 medals for India.
