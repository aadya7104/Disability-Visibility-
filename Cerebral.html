      <h2>What is Cerebral Palsy?</h2>
      <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological condition caused by brain damage and it is the most common motor and movement disability of childhood.<br><br>
Cerebral palsy causes a range of disabilities, from mild to severe. If your child has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, you need to know what to expect. Get the answers to all of your questions so that you can make informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment, therapies, and legal action.<br><br>
As an umbrella term, cerebral palsy refers to a group of symptoms and disabilities. [1] They are all related but each child will have a unique and individual experience of cerebral palsy.<br><br>

<h2> Types of Cerebral Palsy:</h2>
<p>1. Spastic Cerebral Palsy<br>
Spastic cerebral palsy accounts for 75 percent of all cases. It causes increased muscle tone, known as spasticity and causes:<br><br></p>

<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Delayed developmental milestones for moving
</li>
<li class="types">Abnormal movements.

</li>
<li class="types">Movement inhibition.</li>
<li class="types">Stiff and spastic muscles.
</li>
<li class="types">Difficulties controlling muscle movement.</li>
<li class="types">Difficulties moving from one position to another.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spastic quadriplegia impacts a child’s upper and lower limbs and body, severely restricting mobility.<br><br>
Spastic diplegia only affects the lower half of the body. Many of these children can still walk with some impairments and may need assistive devices such as walkers.<br><br>
Spastic hemiplegia affects one side of the body only, usually the arm more than the leg. Most children with hemiplegia can walk.<br><br>
2. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy<br><br>
Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the second most common type of CP. Symptoms include:
</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Dystonia, repetitive and twisting motions.

</li>
<li class="types">Athetosis, writhing movements

</li>
<li class="types">Chorea, unpredictable movements.</li>
<li class="types">Poor posture.

</li>
<li class="types">Painful movements.
</li>
<li class="types">Painful movements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy<br><br>
Ataxic cerebral palsy is the least common. It causes poor balance, limited coordination, tremors, and shaky movements that are difficult to control.<br><br>
4. Mixed Cerebral Palsy<br><br>
Mixed cerebral palsy causes symptoms characteristic of two or three of the other types. Spastic-dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the most common type of mixed CP.

<h2> Facts about Cerebral palsy in India</h2>
<<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Cerebral palsy is the most common movement and motor disability in children. One in approximately 345 kids has CP.

</li>
       <li class="types">About 80 percent of children with the condition have spastic cerebral palsy, which causes increased muscle tone.
 

</li>
        <li class="types">About 3 million kids in India have cp

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Brain damage is the cause of CP, but there are many different things that can trigger damage. [4] For this reason, the exact cause of cerebral palsy can’t always be determined. Possibilities include:
      </p>
    <<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Poor brain development in the womb


</li>
       <li class="types">Maternal infections or medical conditions

</li>
        <li class="types">Disruption of blood flow to the developing brain
</li>
 <li class="types">Genetic conditions

<li class="types">Ingestion of toxins or drugs during pregnancy
</li>
<li class="types">Damage to the head or skull during delivery
 (river blindness)</li>
<li class="types">Complications related to premature delivery.
