      <h2>What is Epilepsy?</h2>
      <p> <b><i> Even though Epilepsy does not come under the Disabilities Act in India we wanted to include  information about it on our website as having the facts and resources for it is equally important.</i></b><br><br>Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations and sometimes loss of awareness.<br><br>
Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.<br><br>
Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two seizures without a known trigger (unprovoked seizures) that happen at least 24 hours apart are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.<br><br>
Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age.<br><br>

<h2>Seizures</h2>
<p>Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Temporary confusion</li>
<li class="types">A staring spell</li>
<li class="types">Stiff muscles</li>
<li class="types"> Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs</li>
<li class="types"> Loss of consciousness or awareness</li>
<li class="types"> Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode.<br><br>
Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins.
<br><br>
<b><u>Focal seizures</b></u><br>When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories:<br></p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types"><b>Focal seizures without loss of consciousness.</b> Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.
</li>
<li class="types"><b>Focal seizures with impaired awareness.</b> Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders.
</p>
<p><b><u>Generalized seizures</b></u><br>Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist.</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types"><b>Absence seizures.</b> Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Tonic seizures.</b> Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Atonic seizures.</b> Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down.</li>
<li class="types"><b>Clonic seizures.</b> Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms.
</li>
<li class="types"><b>Myoclonic seizures.</b>Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs.
</li>
<li class="types"><b>Tonic-clonic seizures.</b>Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Causes</h2>
<p>Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including:</p>
<ul id="list">
  <li class="types">Stroke</li>
  <li class="types">Brain Tumour</li>
  <li class="types">Brain infection</li>
  <li class="types">Traumatic Brain Injury or head injury</li>
  <li class="types">Loss of oxygen to the brain(eg: during birth)</li>
  <li class="types">Certain genetic conditions</li>
  <li class="types">Other neurological conditions</li>
  <li class="types">Alcoholism or Alcohol withdrawal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy:</p>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Age: The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age.

</li>
       <li class="types">Family history: If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder.</li>
        <li class="types">Head injuries: Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury.</li>
        <li class="types">Stroke and other vascular diseases: Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.</li>
<li class="types">Dementia: Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults.</li>
<li class="types">Brain infections: Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk.</li>
<li class="types">Seizures in childhood: High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long fever-associated seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>A doctor may perform a neurological exam and a complete physical exam to pinpoint the cause of the seizures and diagnose epilepsy. Tests used to diagnose epilepsy include:</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">An electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of the brain</li>
        <li class="types">A spinal tap to collect spinal fluid for analysis</li>
        <li class="types">Imaging tests, like an MRI or CT scan, of the head</li>
        </ul>
<p>These blood tests are also commonly used to help diagnose epilepsy or rule out other disorders:</p>
<ul id="list">
  <li class="types">Tests of liver and kidney function</li>
  <li class="types">Blood glucose tests</li>
  <li class="types">Complete blood count and chemistry of the blood</li>
  <li class="types">Tests to diagnose or rule out any infectious diseases</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Epilepsy can be treated through multiple strategies. Usually medication is needed to control seizures and treat epilepsy; these commonly prescribed drugs are called anticonvulsants.<br>
Medication alone can't always stop or reduce seizures. A device called a vagus nerve stimulator may help treat epilepsy if you don’t get relief from medication. The stimulator is surgically placed in the chest. It electrically stimulates a large nerve (the vagus nerve) that runs through the neck. This device is successful in preventing seizures in some people, but even a vagus nerve stimulator can't totally stop seizures from happening.<br>
Some doctors recommend a special diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates to help manage epilepsy. This is called a ketogenic diet, and it may help more than half of people who haven't improved on medicine alone.<br>
If you can't get good control over seizures with medications, diet, or a vagus nerve stimulator, brain surgery to correct the problem might be an option.

      <h2> Stories and talks on Epilepsy</h2>
      <p>Epilepsy is a disorder that puts people in a condition where they are not in control of the nerve cell activity in the brain. The aftereffect of it is the restrictions that it puts on your everyday life. Right from making everyday plans to thinking about the future, people start planning your life in and around epilepsy. But Sharmishta was not willing to bog down by the same. In this video from the REAL STEEL series, sponsored by Tata Steel, we have Sharmishta R. Somayaji, taking us through the way Epilepsy changed the course of her life.
