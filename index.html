    <h1> Why did I make this website?</h1></div>
    <p id="why"> 
      When my younger brother was diagnosed with Cerebral palsy it was a very difficult process for us to navigate how to support him better. With hardly many comprehensive resources addressing the Indian public, we had to compile information by ourselves; this was a very tedious process. <br><br>There is a lot of misinformation and stigma surrounding disability in India. I have come across several ignorant comments while in public with my sibling. More than angry, they made me sad to witness the lack of awareness.<br><br>Hence, through this website I hope to educate the general public on disabiliy etiquette and provide them with ways to support a disabled individual better. I also want to address the stigma surrounding disability. I wish to provide ways and comprehensive resources to disabled individuals and their families to help ease this difficult process for them.<br> If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to reach out using the <a href="contact.html"> contact form</a><br><br></p>

I am a 17-year-old girl from Mumbai, India. I designed this website because my younger brother has cerebral palsy; we, as a family, faced several challenges in learning how to support him better and provide him with the care that he requires. Through this website, I want to address some of those issues and provide support to other families going through the same journey.<br><br>You can reach me here:<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadya-pawar-75087b1aa/"> My LinkedIn</a><br><br><a href="http://www.aadyapawar.com/"> My Website</a> </p>
