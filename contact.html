I am a 17-year-old girl from Mumbai, India. I designed this website because my younger brother has cerebral palsy; we, as a family, faced several challenges in learning how to support him better and provide him with the care that he requires. Through this website, I want to address some of those issues and provide support to other families going through the same journey.<br><br>You can reach me here:<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadya-pawar-75087b1aa/"> My LinkedIn</a><br><br><a href="www.aadyapawar.com"> My Website.</a> </p>
