      <h2>What is Muscular Dystrophy?</h2>
      <p>Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes (mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle.<br><br>
There are many kinds of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood, mostly in boys. Other types don't surface until adulthood.<br><br>
There's no cure for muscular dystrophy. But medications and therapy can help manage symptoms and slow the course of the disease.</p>  <br>

<h2> Types of Muscular dystrophy:</h2>
<p>1. Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease):<br> <br>The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy.<br><br>
2. Duchenne.<br><br>
The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s.<br><br>
3. Becker.<br><br> This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typicallyaffects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood.<br><br>
4. Limb-girdle.<br><br> This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood.<br><br>
5.Facioscapulohumeral.<br><br> Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span.<br><br>
6.Congenital.<br><br> Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures.<br><br>
7.Oculopharyngeal.<br><br> Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur.<br><br>
8.Distal.<br><br> This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet. It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy.<br><br>
9.Emery-Dreifuss.<br><br> This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy.<br><br>

<h2> Facts about Muscular Dystrophy in India</h2>
<<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">DMD is a rare genetic disorder that has affected 0.8 million male children in India.</li>
       <li class="types">The disease usually affects male children between the ages of three and 15.</li>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers. Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is defective.<br><br>Each form of muscular dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation particular to that type of the disease. Most of these mutations are inherited.    </p>

      <h2> Some Symptoms Include</h2>
      <p>Duchenne type muscular dystrophy:<br><br>
      This is the most common form. Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys.</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Frequent falls</li>
          <li class="types">Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting position</li>
            <li class="types">Trouble running and jumping</li>
          <li class="types">Waddling gait</li>
               <li class="types">Walking on the toes</li>
           <li class="types">Large calf muscles</li>
          <li class="types">Muscle pain and stiffness</li>
            <li class="types">Learning disabilities</li>
              <li class="types">Delayed growth</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
<p>Becker muscular dystrophy:<br>
Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later.<br><br><br>
Other types of muscular dystrophy:<br>
Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include:<br><br>
</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Myotonic. This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks.
</li>
          <li class="types">Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD). Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but can begin in childhood or as late as age 50.
</li>
            <li class="types">Congenital. This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2. Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment.
</li>
          <li class="types">Limb-girdle. Hip and shoulder muscles are usually affected first. People with this type of muscular dystrophy might have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and so might trip frequently. Onset usually begins in childhood or the teenage years.
</li>
</ul>

      <h2> Effects</h2>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Trouble walking. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.</li>
         <li class="types"> Trouble using arms. Daily activities can become more difficult if the muscles of the arms and shoulders are affected.</li>
          <li class="types">Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints (contractures). Contractures can further limit mobility</li>
           <li class="types">Breathing problems. Progressive weakness can affect the muscles associated with breathing. People with muscular dystrophy might eventually need to use a breathing assistance device (ventilator), initially at night but possibly also during the day.</li>
            <li class="types">Curved spine (scoliosis). Weakened muscles might be unable to hold the spine straight.         </li>
             <li class="types">Heart problems. Muscular dystrophy can reduce the efficiency of the heart muscle.</li>
              <li class="types">Swallowing problems. If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, nutritional problems and aspiration pneumonia can develop. Feeding tubes might be an option.</li>                
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Although there's no cure for any form of muscular dystrophy, treatment for some forms of the disease can help extend the time a person with the disease can remain mobile and help with heart and lung muscle strength. Trials of new therapies are ongoing.<br><br>
People with muscular dystrophy should be monitored throughout their lives. Their care team should include a neurologist with expertise in neuromuscular diseases, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, and physical and occupational therapists.<br><br>
Some people might also need a lung specialist (pulmonologist), a heart specialist (cardiologist, a sleep specialist, a specialist in the endocrine system (endocrinologist), an orthopedic surgeon and other specialists.<br><br>
Treatment options include medications, physical and occupational therapy, and surgical and other procedures. Ongoing assessments of walking, swallowing, breathing and hand function enable the treatment team to adjust treatments as the disease progresses.
