      <h2>What is Dwarfism?</h2>
      <p>Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimeters) or less. The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).<br>
Many different medical conditions cause dwarfism. In general, the disorders are divided into two broad categories:
</p>  
<ul id="list">
<li class="types"><b>Disproportionate dwarfism </b>: If body size is disproportionate, some parts of the body are small, and others are of average size or above-average size. Disorders causing disproportionate dwarfism inhibit the development of bones.</li>
<li class="types"> <b>Proportionate dwarfism</b> : A body is proportionately small if all parts of the body are small to the same degree and appear to be proportioned like a body of average stature. Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people prefer the term "short stature" or "little people" rather than "dwarf" or "dwarfism." So it's important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this disorder. Short stature disorders do not include familial short stature — short height that's considered a normal variation with normal bone development.</p>

<h2> Symptoms</h2>
<p>Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.
</P>
<p><b><u> Disproportionate dwarfism</u></b><br>
Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.<br><br>
Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).<br><br>
The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:</p>

<ul id="list">
<li class="types">An average-size trunk</li>
<li class="types">Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs
Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers</li>
<li class="types">Limited mobility at the elbows</li>
<li class="types">A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose</li>
<li class="types">Progressive development of bowed legs</li>
<li class="types">Progressive development of swayed lower back</li>
<li class="types">An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)</li>

</ul>
<p>Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:
</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">A very short trunk</li>
<li class="types">A short neck</li>
<li class="types">Shortened arms and legs</li>
<li class="types">Average-size hands and feet</li>
<li class="types">Broad, rounded chest</li>
<li class="types">Slightly flattened cheekbones</li>
<li class="types">Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)</li>
<li class="types">Hip deformities that result in thigh bones turning inward</li>
<li class="types">A foot that's twisted or out of shape</li>
<li class="types">Instability of the neck bones</li>
<li class="types">Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine</li>
<li class="types">Progressive development of swayed lower back</li>
<li class="types">Vision and hearing problems</li>
<li class="types">Arthritis and problems with joint movement</li>
<li class="types">Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u> Proportionate dwarfism</u></b><br>
Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.<br><br>
Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:</p>

<ul id="list">
<li class="types">Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts</li>
<li class="types">Growth rate slower than expected for age</li>
<li class="types">Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years</li>

</ul>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown. Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup.
<br><br>
<b>Achondroplasia</b><br>About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height. A person with achondroplasia and with two average-size parents received one mutated copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene. A person with the disorder may pass along either a mutated or normal copy to his or her own children.
<br><br>
<b>Turner syndrome</b><br>Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only girls and women, results when a sex chromosome (the X chromosome) is missing or partially missing. A female inherits an X chromosome from each parent. A girl with Turner syndrome has only one fully functioning copy of the female sex chromosome rather than two.<br><br>
<b>Growth hormone deficiency</b><br>The cause of growth hormone deficiency can sometimes be traced to a genetic mutation or injury, but for most people with the disorder, no cause can be identified.<br><br>
<b>Other causes</b><br>Other causes of dwarfism include other genetic disorders, deficiencies in other hormones or poor nutrition. Sometimes the cause is unknown.

<h2>Diagnosis </h2>
<p>At birth, sometimes the appearance of a newborn may be enough to make a diagnosis of dwarfism. As part of baby wellness exams, your child should be measured and weighed to see how they compare to the population averages for a child their age. Consistently measuring in the lowest quartiles on the standard growth chart is another sign a pediatrician can use to diagnose dwarfism.<br><br>
Making a tentative prenatal diagnosis while the baby is still in the womb can be done with an ultrasound. If the baby’s appearance suggests dwarfism, or if the parents know they carry a gene for dwarfism, a doctor may recommend amniocentesis . This is a lab test of amniotic fluid from the womb.<br><br>
Genetic testing may be helpful in some cases. This is particularly true when distinguishing one potential cause of dwarfism from another. A blood test to check for growth hormone levels may also help confirm a diagnosis of dwarfism caused by hormone deficiency.

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Dwarfism, regardless of the cause, can’t be cured or “corrected.” However, there are certain therapies that may help reduce the risk of complications.
<br><br><b>Hormone therapy</b><br>For people with growth hormone deficiency, injections of synthetic human growth hormone may be helpful. Children receiving this treatment don’t always reach an average height, but they can get close.
<br>The treatment includes daily injections when a child is young, though injections may continue into a person’s 20s. This may be done if there are concerns about full adult maturation and sufficient muscle and fat.<br>
Girls with Turner’s syndrome  need estrogen therapy and other hormones to help trigger puberty and appropriate female development. Estrogen therapy may be necessary until a woman reaches the age of menopause.<br><br>
<b>Surgical options</b><br>For others with dwarfism, surgical treatments may be necessary and helpful to living a longer, healthier life.
Surgical treatments include those that can help:</p>
<ul id="list">
<li class="types">correct the direction of bone growth
</li>
<li class="types">stabilize the spine
</li>
<li class="types">increase the channel in the vertebrae surrounding the spinal cord to relieve pressure on the spinal cord
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another surgical procedure for people with excess fluid around the brain is to place a type of tube, called a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ventriculoperitoneal-shunt">shunt</a>, in the brain. This can relieve some of that fluid and reduce pressure on the brain.
<br><br><b>Physical therapy and orthotics
</b><br>Physical therapy and orthotics are noninvasive solutions to some complications of dwarfism. Physical therapy is often prescribed after limb or back surgery to help you regain or improve your range of motion and strength. Physical therapy may also be advised if dwarfism is affecting the way you walk or is causing you pain that doesn’t require surgery.
Orthotics are custom-made devices that fit into your shoes to help improve your foot health and function. If dwarfism is affecting your balance, how you walk, or other aspects of foot function, talk with a podiatrist about how orthotics may help you.

      <h2> Stories of people with dwarfism</h2>
      <p>A FAMILY in the Indian city of Hyderabad always stand out in a crowd - because nine of the 11 family members are dwarves. Fifty-two-year-old Ram Raj Chauhan is the head of the family who have been affected by a genetic condition called Achondroplasia, which causes short limbed dwarfism. Incredibly, Ram Raj’s family once consisted of 21 people - 18 of whom suffered from the condition.

<br><br>
<p>A man with dwarfism has become a giant in the world of badminton - despite being only 4 feet 2 inches tall. Mark Dharmai, a fisherman’s son, is not only making India proud by winning medals internationally, but has also become a beacon of hope and inspiration for the dwarf community. 32-year-old Dharma, from Mumbai, India, was born with a form of dwarfism called Achondroplasia, which results in short arms and legs. But since taking up badminton Mark has won over 50 medals in tournaments across the world.
