      <h2>What is Thalassemia?</h2>
      <p>Thalassemia is an inherited (i.e., passed from parents to children through genes) blood disorder caused when the body doesn’t make enough of a protein called hemoglobin, an important part of red blood cells. When there isn’t enough hemoglobin, the body’s red blood cells don’t function properly and they last shorter periods of time, so there are fewer healthy red blood cells traveling in the bloodstream. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all the cells of the body. Oxygen is a sort of food that cells use to function. When there are not enough healthy red blood cells, there is also not enough oxygen delivered to all the other cells of the body, which may cause a person to feel tired, weak or short of breath. This is a condition called anemia. People with thalassemia may have mild or severe anemia. Severe anemia can damage organs and lead to death.

<h2> Facts about Thalassemia in India</h2>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">India has the largest number of children with Thalassemia Major in the world, about 1 to 1.5 lakh, and about 10,000-15,000 children having Thalassemia Major are born every year.

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Thalassemia majorly is an inherited genetic disease. It occurs when there’s an abnormality or mutation in one of the genes involved in hemoglobin production.

      <h2> Symptoms</h2>
      <p>There are several types of thalassemia. The signs and symptoms you have depend on the type and severity of your condition. <br><br>
      Thalassemia signs and symptoms can include:
      </p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Fatigue
</li>
          <li class="types">Weakness
</li>
            <li class="types">Pale or Yellowish skin/ Jaundice
</li>
              <li class="types">Facial Bone Deformities
</li>
                <li class="types">Slow growth
</li>
<li class="types">Abdominal swelling 
</li>
<li class="types">Dark Urine
</li>
<li class="types">Enlarged spleen
</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
<p>Some babies show signs and symptoms of thalassemia at birth; others develop them during the first two years of life. Some people who have only one affected hemoglobin gene don't have thalassemia symptoms.</p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>   If you think you may have thalassemia, or if your parents have it, you should see a doctor. They will examine you and will ask questions. Children with moderate to severe thalassemia usually have signs by age 2.<br>
If a doctor suspects thalassemia, you’ll take blood tests. One is a CBC (complete blood count) test. The other is a hemoglobin electrophoresis test.<br>
If you are baby or trying to have a baby, you can have tests to learn if your baby will have the condition.
<br>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types"><a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/genetic-testing">Genetic testing </a> show if you or your partner carries any of the genes that cause thalassemia.

</li>
         <li class="types"><a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/chorionic-villus-sampling">Chorionic villus sampling</a> tests a tiny piece of the placenta to see if a baby has the genes that cause thalassemia. Doctors usually do this test around the 11th week of pregnancy.

</li>
          <li class="types">Amniocentesis tests the fluid around an unborn baby. Doctors usually do this test around the 16th week of pregnancy.</li>
           
      </ul></p>
   <p>
   If you do have thalassemia, you should see a blood expert known as a hematologist. You may also need other special doctors on your team, like those who treat the heart or liver.

      <h2>Treatments</h2>
    <p>   If you have thalassemia, follow these habits to stay well:
<br>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Eat a healthy diet to keep your bones strong and give you energy.

</li>
         <li class="types">If you get a fever or feel ill, see your doctor.

</li>
          <li class="types">Stay away from sick people and wash your hands often.</li>
  <li class="types">Ask your doctor about supplements like calcium and vitamin D.
</li>
  <li class="types">Don’t take iron pills.
</li>         
      </ul></p>
   <p>
   With a mild case, you may feel tired and not need treatment. But if it’s more serious, your organs may not get the oxygen they need. Treatment might include:
<br>
<ul id="list">
        <li class="types">Blood transfusions: A transfusion is a way to get donated blood or parts of blood that your body needs, like hemoglobin. How often you need transfusions can vary. Some people have one every few weeks. Your transfusion schedule may change as you get older.


</li>
         <li class="types">Chelation therapy: Blood transfusions are important for people with thalassemia. But they can cause too much iron in the blood. That can lead to problems with the heart, liver, and blood sugar. If you get transfusions, you and your doctor will talk about whether you need medicine that can help remove extra iron from your body.


</li>
          <li class="types">Stem cell or bone marrow transplant: An infusion of stem cells from a matched donor can sometimes cure thalassemia.
</li>
  <li class="types">Supplements: In some cases, your doctor might recommend that you take extra folic acid or other supplements.

</li>
  <li class="types">Surgery:Some people with thalassemia may need their spleen removed.

</li>         
      </ul>

      <h2> People's experiences with Thalassemia </h2>
      <p>A mother of 150 thalassaemic children, Mrs. Sujata Raikar founded the SAATH Trust which takes up the responsibility of total medical expense of treatment of Thalassaemic children. She devotes her major time in spreading awareness about Thalasemia. Up until now she has given information about thalassaemia to more than 4 lakh people through different mediums. Watch these videos do understand how thalassemia manifests, what can be done to prevent it and the story behind SAATH foundation.
